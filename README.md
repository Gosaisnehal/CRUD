# CRUD

This is  a small MVC application that will demonstrate the use of Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality (CRUD).
This Application will be aimed at creating a small Calendar which will allow Users to Create a Contact and store some basic information about them.

I assume that you will be creating the Database on the server provided and then connecting to the database to then read data from it. 
You will also be inserting into this database and deleting data from it. 

Application created using .NET framework 4.6.1 in Visual Studio 2015.
